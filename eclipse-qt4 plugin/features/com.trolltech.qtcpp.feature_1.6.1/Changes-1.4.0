The Qt Eclipse Integration version 1.4.0 updates to Qt 4.4.0 and fixes lots of bugs.

Changes 
------- 

* Fixed 64 bit build.
* Add only Qt include paths that exist (removes an Eclipse warning about missing include paths).
* Added Qt Eclipse Integration to Eclipse's Welcome page.
* Fixed that Eclipse 3.3 always started up with the default workspace when Qt Eclipse Integration was installed.
* Fixed inline editing (e.g. of button texts in form editor) on Linux.
* Fixed that the property editor didn't affect the form editor if the property editor was opened first.
* Made "debug" the default target instead of using Qt's default setting.
* Fixed crash that could occur when the Qt 3 based qtgtkengine is used for Eclipse.
* Fixed behavior of the editors in case they refer to a non-existing file.
* Made the editors aware of resource changes/deletions and project closes.
* Fixed clipboard integration between Eclipse/SWT and Qt views that lead to long delays.
